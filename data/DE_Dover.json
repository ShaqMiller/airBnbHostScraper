I started this business to offer my service of car sharing to my community which I knew I could provide a better, more reliable, easy process, and lower cost experience when renting a car. Here, you donâ€™t have to worry about waiting in a line or the inconvenient opening and closing times that may not fit your schedule. I knew I could offer a better experience at a very reasonable value and I accomplished just that with Blitz 38. A little backstory, Dover has always been home to me which encourages me more to find ways that can benefit those around me. Iâ€™m a motivated father thatâ€™s grateful everyday for life. I'm a business man, day trader and a father thatâ€™s determined to succeed. I take pride in delivering good service and it feels great to help people in need.  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is anything that I can do to meet all of your rentals needs. \r\n\r\nCome watch me grow my fleet of vehicles!","school":""}}}}
