KY","languages":"","openEndedText":"Brosive, Hailey, Susan and I will try our best to make sure your Turo guest experience is exceptional. Our team appreciates you supporting us as there are many options with your vehicle choices. Susan & I moved to Louisville 5 years ago from Los Angeles - we love Louisville and if you're visiting from out of town, we know you'll love it too!\r\n\r\nTop 6 Reasons for using Turo:\r\n1. No lines, counter time or waiting at the rental car agency. Just sign in and book. \r\n2. No bait and switch. The rental car agencies are notorious for \"similar\" vehicles to the one you booked, sometimes giving you a vehicle that's in a lower class than the one you booked. Here with Turo, and our vehicles, you know exactly what you're driving.\r\n3. No cancellations - twice this has happened to me at the car rental agencies. I've booked a car only to find out they overbooked and don't have my car. This is impossible with Turo because the vehicle is in your name once you book it.\r\n4. Direct contact with hosts. Susan, Taylor and I try to communicate early and often. This helps if there an issue, emergency, general question or even just friendly banter. We've become friends with a couple guests - how awesome.\r\n5. Constant availability. You can browse, book and pick up & drop off 24/7. We don't close, but the airport and around town rental agency counters do. While not all Turo vehicles are available nonstop, we try hard to make most of our vehicles 24/7 pickup and definitely 24/7 drop off. Turo Go and lockboxes make this a perfect way to go.\r\n6. Small & dedicated local work crew. We take pride in our vehicles and our guests. We're local & you're helping local.\r\n\r\nThe sharing economy got better when Turo arrived. I first rented a couple cars from Turo which were great experiences. In 2017 the time came for listing a great vehicle... my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It's an amazing ride with plenty of room and a smoothness that's rare for an SUV. \r\n\r\n2020 brought the first truck into the picture and a new city, Louisville. The Ford F-150 is the top selling truck and it's an amazing vehicle. Excited I'm able to share it with others.\r\n\r\nSpring 2021 felt like a good time to add the first hybrid vehicle, the Honda Accord. This vehicle is located in Louisville and solidifies our roots in both Los Angeles and Louisville. And this car, wow, amazing drive and technology that rivals any vehicle out there.\r\n\r\nDecember 2021 saw the addition of Susan's Lexus - the 2016 Lexus NX 200Turbo F-Sport (what a long name). This vehicle sold in 2022 after an accident :(\r\n\r\nSpring of 2022 saw a Ford Focus & Hyundai Elantra addition to help round out the Louisville choices. Basic vehicles with a lower cost to book.\r\n\r\nSummer 2022 saw the addition of a VW Jetta and finally a 7 seater - the Dodge Journey. Super excited we have such a well rounded mix now.\r\n\r\nFall of '22 came with three vehicles: 2020 Lexus NX300, 2021 Toyota Corolla and 2023 VW Taos. We couldn't be more excited to bring these vehicles to market for you.\r\n\r\nThe SUV in '23 - the full size Tahoe and less than full size but highly capable Bronco Sport were both added in 2023. Both of these SUV's are amazing.\r\n\r\nIn the back half of 2023 and early 2024 we added quite a few vehicles: a bunch of 2024's and some budget conscious vehicles. Too many to list - we're growing!\r\n\r\nLet Hailey, Brosive, Joel and Susan help make your travels better & easier :)\r\n\r\nTuro's an extra way for us to join the sharing economy and we love helping people that need a car. We truly believe we're better than the big car rental agencies - please give us a shot.\r\n","school":"Calabasas High > Cal State Northridge"}}},"5099461":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":149.4,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":0,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":5099461,"id":2517152,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/HSxaOqKWSEiX8nar1Nc1Gw.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/HSxaOqKWSEiX8nar1Nc1Gw.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":false,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Elizabethtown","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":38.52601928073125},"homeLocation":{"lat":37.726926951846075,"lng":-85.8485607467083},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"elizabethtown-ky","en_GB":"elizabethtown-ky","en_CA":"elizabethtown-ky","en_US":"elizabethtown-ky","en_AU":"elizabethtown-ky","fr_FR":"elizabethtown-ky"},"state":"KY"},"make":"Land Rover","model":"Defender","rating":null,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[],"type":"SUV","year":2020}],"details":{"name":"Mohamed M.","firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"M.","id":5099461,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/EYMBhsmrSoO4M6L6dGABVA.jpg","bio":{"employment":"Own a business","home":"Elizabethtown Kentucky","languages":"English","openEndedText":"","school":"University of Wolverhampton"}}},"7022547":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":66.61,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":0,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":7022547,"id":2633614,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/UUDiolsnQn6Lz6hvfEkPtg.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/UUDiolsnQn6Lz6hvfEkPtg.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":false,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Charlestown","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":9.700004713345166},"homeLocation":{"lat":38.41590971008332,"lng":-85.70670395812704},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"charlestown-in","en_GB":"charlestown-in","en_CA":"charlestown-in","en_US":"charlestown-in","en_AU":"charlestown-in","fr_FR":"charlestown-in"},"state":"IN"},"make":"Ford","model":"Bronco Sport","rating":null,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[],"type":"SUV","year":2021}],"details":{"name":"Kevin F.","firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"F.","id":7022547,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/g-ZFXaT9TfCtGR6NXkWZZA.jpg","bio":{"employment":"Software Engineer","home":"Charlestown, IN","languages":"","openEndedText":"","school":"Indiana University"}}},"8003210":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":74.67,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":35,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":8003210,"id":757187,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/04kPKhoOTPCbvZZHeO219w.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/04kPKhoOTPCbvZZHeO219w.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Louisville","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":2.4050194798332822},"homeLocation":{"lat":38.26955706214668,"lng":-85.7803319946746},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"louisville-ky","en_GB":"louisville-ky","en_CA":"louisville-ky","en_US":"louisville-ky","en_AU":"louisville-ky","fr_FR":"louisville-ky"},"state":"KY"},"make":"Jeep","model":"Gladiator","rating":5,"seoCategory":"TRUCK","tags":[],"type":"TRUCK","year":2020},{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":51.85,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":5,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":8003210,"id":2495330,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/Iy78Ikq9Qxa1z1gaW-Y9Jw.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/Iy78Ikq9Qxa1z1gaW-Y9Jw.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Louisville","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":2.4703052658388613},"homeLocation":{"lat":38.26711423667379,"lng":-85.78073460582222},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"louisville-ky","en_GB":"louisville-ky","en_CA":"louisville-ky","en_US":"louisville-ky","en_AU":"louisville-ky","fr_FR":"louisville-ky"},"state":"KY"},"make":"FIAT","model":"500c","rating":5,"seoCategory":"CAR","tags":[],"type":"CAR","year":2014}],"details":{"name":"Kinetic R.","firstName":"Kinetic","lastName":"R.","id":8003210,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/UODnuh2WRwybb1vU9RIVPQ.jpg","bio":{"employment":"It / Turo","home":"Louisville, Kentucky","languages":"English","openEndedText":"Kinetic Rentals, a premier Turo rental company in Louisville, sets the standard for exceptional car rental experiences.

We are appreciative of you, and we will strive to make this the best experience possible.  \n\nTop 6 Reasons for using Turo:\n1. No lines, counter time or waiting at the rental car agency. Just sign in and book.\n2. No bait and switch. The rental car agencies are notorious for \"similar\" vehicles to the one you booked, sometimes giving you a vehicle that's in a lower class than the one you booked. Here with Turo, and our vehicles, you know exactly what you're driving.\n3. No cancellations - twice this has happened to me at the car rental agencies. I've booked a car only to find out they overbooked and don't have my car. This is impossible with Turo because the vehicle is in your name once you book it.\n4. Direct contact with hosts. We try to communicate early and often. This helps if there an issue, emergency, general question or even just friendly banter. We've become friends with a couple guests - how awesome.\n5. Constant availability. You can browse, book and pick up & drop off 24/7. We don't close, but the airport and around town rental agency counters do. While not all Turo vehicles are available nonstop, we try hard to make most of our vehicles 24/7 pickup and definitely 24/7 drop off. Turo Go and lockboxes make this a perfect way to go.\n6. No employees, just owners. We take pride in our vehicles and our guests. We're local & you're helping local.
