After settling down in Grand Rapids a few years back, I started a family and planted roots where I grew up. \r\n\r\nI started using Turo as a guest during a Texas trip in 2016. Since becoming a Turo host in 2022, I have been able to experience many awesome cars and reduce ownership costs by sharing the cars with others.\r\n\r\nAs a car enthusiast, I take great pride in the maintenance and upkeep of all the cars on my Turo account. Safety is my top priority, so my vehicles are well-maintained and in excellent condition. I expect my guests to treat the cars with the same respect and care they would give to their own vehicles.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about my listed cars or a future rental. I'm here to help make your Turo experience as smooth and stress-free as possible.","school":"Grand Valley State University"}}}}
