I’m a California native who owns her own jewelry business and is a food scientist. I work a lot from home. It’s always been my dream to travel across the country in a vintage airstream!\n\nScion ia\n\nAre you ready to drive, the already, classic 2016 Scion iA! The Scion iA has plenty of weird qualities, from its conception to the brand it used to belong to. And since it's a subcompact, you can also call it slow and joyless without anybody batting an eye, however, it will get you from point A to point B while saving you some dough, money, crypto etc. This is a great little cruiser that can get you a 53.3 mpg car ride! \nAs the story goes, Toyota and Mazda signed a partnership a couple of years back. Part of the agreement was for the then all-new Mazda2 sedan to be shipped from Mexico to the States as the Scion iA.\nThe Scion brand has been discontinued this year and you can now, have the chance, to experience its sleek yet intellectually geeky vibes. This baby is equipped with Navigation, great Bluetooth pairing sound, ice-cold A/C and toasty heat. \n\nFIAT 500 Pop with Dr. Dre Beats\n\nNot too long ago, the words \"compact\" and \"economical\" were equated with cheap and dull when it came to cars. Nowadays, it seems as if some small and affordable transports are not just agreeable and fun, but even desirable. Leading the charge is the 2013 Fiat 500, with its distinctly Italian take on the subcompact.\n\nAs one of the smallest cars on sale today, the Fiat 500 somehow manages to deliver heartily on a number of levels. From the outside, the charm of the original Fiat Cinquecento (500) from decades past lives on in the styling of today's modern interpretation. Inside, front passengers are treated to a surprisingly spacious cabin that is adorned with plenty of contemporary niceties. Add to that a pleasantly lively driving experience and favorable fuel economy figures, and it's no wonder why the Fiat 500 is one of our top recommended coupes.\n\n\nChevrolet Spark\n\nFor 2014, the Chevrolet Spark receives a new continuously variable transmission (CVT) that replaces the previous four-speed automatic. Chevy says the CVT reduces engine noise on the freeway and increases both fuel economy and acceleration. With each passing year, more and more subcompacts have been coming out for sale. These small, fuel-sipping cars are affordable and ideal for urban use. Inside the Spark, you'll find a simple, clean design with enough chic sculpting and color flourishes to help you overlook the hard plastic surfaces. And while the base model is somewhat spartan, it comes standard with power windows, air-conditioning and a radio. Based on pricing and practicality, the four-door Chevrolet Spark is one of the best subcompact cars available for 2014. The EPA estimates fuel economy at 34 mpg combined (31 mpg city/39 mpg highway) for the manual and 34 mpg combined (30 mpg city/39 mpg highway) for the CVT.\n\nInstagram: jewelrybyelmira \nFacebook Elmira Thomas \nWebsite elmirajewelry.com","school":"Saddleback"}}},"26172466":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":46.2,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":60,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":26172466,"id":1557142,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/emFRRwANRuir2WJul95Oxw.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/emFRRwANRuir2WJul95Oxw.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Irvine","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":19.363414546337136},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.683851401368536,"lng":-117.78038176992816},"isDelivery":true,"locationId":14000030,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"irvine-ca","en_GB":"irvine-ca","en_CA":"irvine-ca","en_US":"irvine-ca","en_AU":"irvine-ca","fr_FR":"irvine-ca"},"state":"CA"},"make":"Tesla","model":"Model Y","rating":5,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[{"label":"Free pickup at station","type":"FREE_DELIVERY"}],"type":"SUV","year":2021}],"details":{"name":"Brent I.","firstName":"Brent","lastName":"I.","id":26172466,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/hR2d_Cv5Sma_hpi6Z7HVPg.jpg","bio":{"employment":"","home":"","languages":"","openEndedText":"","school":""}}},"34385962":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":122.14,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":0,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":34385962,"id":2105053,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/i4JRR8McTV-RQWBXL0hlzw.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/i4JRR8McTV-RQWBXL0hlzw.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"San Clemente","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":2.7267270098692284},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.453031458473426,"lng":-117.5927859620622},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"san-clemente-ca","en_GB":"san-clemente-ca","en_CA":"san-clemente-ca","en_US":"san-clemente-ca","en_AU":"san-clemente-ca","fr_FR":"san-clemente-ca"},"state":"CA"},"make":"Ford","model":"Mustang Mach-E","rating":null,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[],"type":"SUV","year":2022}],"details":{"name":"Patrick N.","firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"N.","id":34385962,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/PGkCvrfqTH-gJMptAs6E2w.jpg","bio":{"employment":"","home":"","languages":"","openEndedText":"","school":""}}}}
