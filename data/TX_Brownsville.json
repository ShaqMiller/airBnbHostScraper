We have now expanded and serve all the valley from South Padre Island to McAllen area and have the largest Turo fleet in South Texas.

These vehicles are always well maintained, newest models, serviced regularly, and clean with low miles. \r\n\r\nWe also have some airbnb rentals where we give discounts for vehicles. Some of our loyal guests rent our beach house and we give them deals on vehicles.
