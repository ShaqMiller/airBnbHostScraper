Thanks so much for choosing CARVIA, LLC. We are locally owned and operated! My team is passionate about cars and a great guest experience! My name is Mike, a former tech business owner in South Texas. I sold my business in 2021 and had a couple cars collecting dust. I missed the customer interaction. I've always been passionate about cars. In 2022, I started renting cars from Valley International Airport (VIA) in Harlingen and carvia was born (car+via for Valley International Airport)!! We have now expanded and serve all the valley from South Padre Island to McAllen area and have the largest Turo fleet in South Texas. We are proud to live and work in South Texas and have always been dedicated to our community through community service projects and reinvesting time and profits to our local community! \r\n\r\nCheck out our Instagram @carvia.rent\r\n\r\nWe are locally owned and operated in the valley and take pride in our area. South Texas is an amazing place to live, work, and visit! We are so excited to offer some amazing vehicles that get you to your vacation, your business trip, weddings, graduations, your family gatherings, SpaceX launches, and everything in between. \r\n\r\nThe cars at carvia are the upgraded models and not the base as some others you’ll find on Turo and on other traditional rental car companies. These vehicles are always well maintained, newest models, serviced regularly, and clean with low miles. \r\n\r\nWe also have some airbnb rentals where we give discounts for vehicles. Some of our loyal guests rent our beach house and we give them deals on vehicles. Check out our most recent Beach House at https://spirentals.com/property-info/405759.html. \r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration. You are in good hands and great care with us. Check us out and see why most Turo guests choose carvia for first time use and the most return guests in South Texas! We know you will love our selection of vehicles and you'll be happy with your experience with us!! Don't just rent a vehicle... enhance your experience!
