Welcome to my Turo Profile.\r\n\r\nI work in the Tech field as an Engineer, have been a super host on Airbnb since 2016 and also have been a Power Host on Turo since 2015. We have a great team of people who handle cleaning, maintenance and making sure your reservation goes smoothly. \r\n\r\nWe support our heroes! Military members and veterans, please let us know when you make a reservation. We offer extras for our heroes.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning on keeping the car long term please let us know and we will make the car unavailable for others. About 50-60% of my cars are not visible to the public so the long term renters can keep them until they're done with them with no interruption.\r\n\r\nCheck in, Check outs are all remote and contactless. During your reservation I will send you easy and clear step by step instructions on how to do contactless check in, gain access to the car and let yourself in, and drop it off remotely. There will be no confusion with me and I always answer questions as fast as I can (please see my reviews). If you are looking for a host you can count on then look no further.
