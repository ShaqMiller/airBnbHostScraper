I am from Moldova, but have lived in Arizona for the last two decades. My professional background is in the legal field, but I'm also a car enthusiast, and I have a specific interest in electric cars. \n\nEach vehicle in my fleet isn't just a rental; it's a personal choice- a car I'd happily take for a spin myself. I've learned to take care of everything in my life, and that philosophy extends to my four-wheeled companions.\n\nFrom zippy electric rides to robust gas guzzlers, my fleet covers all the bases. Whether you're panning a weekend escape, a family road trip, or just need a reliable ride for errands, I've got you covered.\n\nNow, let's talk honesty, cleanliness, and punctuality. These aren't just virtues to me; they're the backbone of my approach. I believe in being upfront about my cars and delivering on time, and I appreciate it when my guests reciprocate with respect for the vehicles I provide.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'm not just a Turo host – I'm a guy who loves what he does, takes pride in his cars, and wants you to experience the same joy and reliability that I get from them. So, if you're in Arizona and need a set of wheels, hit me up. I've got the keys to your next great drive!\n\nHere is my small fleet of 10 cars (you can also find them by scrolling through my profile):\n\n\n2017 Chevrolet Bolt (Fully electric - 263 miles of range)\n2022 Tesla Model 3 (Fully Electric - 260 miles of range)\n2022 Tesla Model Y (7 seats and - 320 miles of range)\n2017 VW Tiguan (AWD & 7 seats - regular Gas vehicle)\n2017 Chrysler Pacifica (8 seats - comfortable, family)\n2016 & 2017 Fiat 500e (limited range electric Car for short distances). \n","school":""}}},"109167":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":129.28,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":13,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":109167,"id":2424207,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/mIyenJymQWeNxQMHB0RAtw.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/mIyenJymQWeNxQMHB0RAtw.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":false,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Chandler","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":20.934086996902856},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.256943011404886,"lng":-111.85951409855561},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"chandler-az","en_GB":"chandler-az","en_CA":"chandler-az","en_US":"chandler-az","en_AU":"chandler-az","fr_FR":"chandler-az"},"state":"AZ"},"make":"Rivian","model":"R1T","rating":4.8462,"seoCategory":"TRUCK","tags":[],"type":"TRUCK","year":2023}],"details":{"name":"Kevin C.","firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"C.","id":109167,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/6GFQdm6xSoGyOhQxJtxS_A.jpg","bio":{"employment":"Strong Asset Management","home":"Scottsdale, Arizona","languages":"English","openEndedText":"","school":"NYU"}}},"137129":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":46.88,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":67,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":137129,"id":1478518,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/89tPAOHARk2B1snuCxlNyg.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/89tPAOHARk2B1snuCxlNyg.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Tempe","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":20.579149232798787},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.40202820555905,"lng":-111.9065201266997},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"tempe-az","en_GB":"tempe-az","en_CA":"tempe-az","en_US":"tempe-az","en_AU":"tempe-az","fr_FR":"tempe-az"},"state":"AZ"},"make":"Toyota","model":"Tacoma","rating":4.9818,"seoCategory":"TRUCK","tags":[],"type":"TRUCK","year":2022}],"details":{"name":"Michael S.","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"S.","id":137129,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/VLekmcuuSSKcsKOjSmK7mg.jpg","bio":{"employment":"Phoenix","home":"Tempe","languages":"","openEndedText":"I love cars, work in the corporate tax field and have been doing this since it began!

We are a trusted host on Turo.\r\n-Call  for booking support and question please call 702-703-4599\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the instructions and pieces of information you need to know about us and our rental.\r\n\r\n1.) ID verification: Two photos will be requested: your valid driver's license photo and your selfie photo holding your driver's license. If you don't have it, it's expired, or you don’t feel comfortable providing it, you are unable to book.\r\n\r\n2.) We are open 24/7; we have your time covered for morning or night pick-up and drop-off.\r\n\r\n3.) We have a delivery service to your location or airport, but take note that this service is not free. Just choose delivery and input the location where you want us to drop off the car.\r\n\r\n4.) Got a flat tire and a dead battery during the trip? No worries. Call Turo roadside assistance at +1 415 965 4525.\r\n\r\n5.) Need extras? We offer baby and booster seats, prepaid fuel, one-way trips (SAN-AZ-LAS), camping tents, etc.\r\n\r\n6.) NO PETS, NO SMOKING, OR VAPING: No smoking or pets are allowed in the vehicles. (Other renters might be allergic.) Absolutely no tobacco, marijuana, liquid, etc. smoking or vaping in the vehicle. Violators will be pursued for up to the full extent of Turo's $250 smoking fine. We are forced to utilize professional ozone decontamination when this occurs.\r\n\r\n7.) GAS MUST BE REFILLED: Gas must be refilled back to the same level that you picked up. If you are in a hurry, do not refill the gas. We will charge a pro-rated amount of gas plus a $10 convenience fee. No hard feelings whatsoever. So the gas might not be full when you pick it up because the previous guest didn't fill it up. Just return it to the same level.\r\n\r\n8.) Any TOLL ROAD citation or PARKING citation will be requested. Please pay the TOLL or any parking ticket if you received any!

Arizona","languages":"English, Vietnamese","openEndedText":"Welcome to my page! Want to learn excess information about me? Click down below to learn more!\r\n\r\nHello, my name is Johnny Vo and I am an aspiring physical therapy student aiming to pay off my Doctorate's in Physical Therapy by myself!\r\nI am 26 years old and my birthday is October 26, 1995. A Scorpio 🦂! Take that knowledge as you will. I just recently finished my bachelor’s at Arizona State University as of 2022! Woot Woot 🙌\r\n\r\nI graduated a little late compared to a lot of other people my age but that’s a long story related to some family shabam I will not bore you with unless you want to be bored with. I was actually born in Sacramento California but our family moved here to Arizona back in 2002 and we have been here since! I love the desert and all of it’s brown dusty beauty. The sunsets here are one of a kind and the drives through the mountains are inviting and relaxing. \r\n\r\nI have traveled to many places likes Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, and even outside the United States to Vietnam! I’m fluent in Vietnamese since I was raised bilingual. I do know a small amount of Spanish as well in case someone needs assistance. \r\n\r\nMy hobbies are not as excited as many other people. I dabbled in a little bit of anything because I get pretty bored fast; however, I am a long term practitioner for mixed martial arts specializing in Muay Thai for health and conditioning but nothing too fancy. So if you like fighting, we can totally talk about that! I love being active as since I am very into the human body and the kinesiology behind it. Everything from how the body moves and how it should move biomechanically for each individual is absolutely striking to me. \r\n\r\nThis leads me to why I have decided to pop onto Turo as not only a way to get connected with the car lovers of the world, but to learn more on how to properly make extra income on the side in order to pay for my upcoming Doctorate’s of Physical Therapy program. I’m not sure if y’all knew this, apparently a Doctorate program is not cheap regardless of what field you decide to take🥴. I know going on a car app is such an oddball and random approach compared to everything I have been involved in but hey, it sounds like fun. And in the end, isn’t that what we’re all on this app to do? Rent a car for a fun trip somewhere? Or rent a car for a fun leisurely ride for the weekend? Or a fun ride to… work? Regardless of the factor, I think this is a cool app to play with and I’m all for it. I can even rent my dream car on here which is a Maserati for a weekend 👀 It’s kind of cool being able to just rent and test drive all sorts of different cars. I think this will be a fun experience for both me and you! \r\n\r\nIf you want to stay connected with me and get to know me better as a person, I do have a Facebook and Instagram that I hardly use! Feel free to add me on both and don’t be a stranger! \r\nI go by Asianinboots on Instagram! Long story, but it’s a fun one! I’m full of stories.

We know how to take care of our vehicles and have pride of ownership 🙂","school":"University of Phoenix"}}},"35177816":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":79.86,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":29,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":35177816,"id":2157616,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/lt3UU5YYTAepQoUO5lQmRA.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/lt3UU5YYTAepQoUO5lQmRA.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Mesa","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":12.157825821685678},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.45267134961042,"lng":-111.75599453131534},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"mesa-az","en_GB":"mesa-az","en_CA":"mesa-az","en_US":"mesa-az","en_AU":"mesa-az","fr_FR":"mesa-az"},"state":"AZ"},"make":"Ford","model":"Bronco","rating":5,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[],"type":"SUV","year":2022},{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":74.09,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":24,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":35177816,"id":2157536,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/l-V06rqfQfq0XR4-dTCLbg.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/l-V06rqfQfq0XR4-dTCLbg.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Mesa","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":12.157825821685678},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.45267134961042,"lng":-111.75599453131534},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"mesa-az","en_GB":"mesa-az","en_CA":"mesa-az","en_US":"mesa-az","en_AU":"mesa-az","fr_FR":"mesa-az"},"state":"AZ"},"make":"Jaguar","model":"F-PACE","rating":5,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[],"type":"SUV","year":2023}],"details":{"name":"Michael L.","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"L.","id":35177816,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/NE0Y5PkESRK3aNDoukd4vQ.jpg","bio":{"employment":"","home":"","languages":"","openEndedText":"","school":""}}},"35335609":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":85.69,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":29,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":35335609,"id":2373988,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/S2W4X1TFTi60rqDF51mMXg.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/S2W4X1TFTi60rqDF51mMXg.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Gilbert","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":14.543016624809335},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.35634159505448,"lng":-111.79217760620591},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"gilbert-az","en_GB":"gilbert-az","en_CA":"gilbert-az","en_US":"gilbert-az","en_AU":"gilbert-az","fr_FR":"gilbert-az"},"state":"AZ"},"make":"Alfa Romeo","model":"Stelvio","rating":4.913,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[],"type":"SUV","year":2023}],"details":{"name":"Cori T.","firstName":"Cori","lastName":"T.","id":35335609,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/rNE869OuTcOp4HMrhkRmbA.jpg","bio":{"employment":"","home":"Gilbert, Arizona","languages":"","openEndedText":"","school":""}}},"35886646":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":39.74,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":28,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":35886646,"id":2466540,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/3-DWBv6OTK2ta0LygJMD_w.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/3-DWBv6OTK2ta0LygJMD_w.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Gilbert","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":14.309412769455927},"homeLocation":{"lat":33.31536494097307,"lng":-111.76750197619951},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"gilbert-az","en_GB":"gilbert-az","en_CA":"gilbert-az","en_US":"gilbert-az","en_AU":"gilbert-az","fr_FR":"gilbert-az"},"state":"AZ"},"make":"MINI","model":"Hardtop 2 Door","rating":5,"seoCategory":"CAR","tags":[],"type":"CAR","year":2013}],"details":{"name":"Matt U.","firstName":"Matt","lastName":"U.","id":35886646,"image":"https://images.turo.com/media/driver/uYgGHtC1SkiVo3aB6VXO7g.jpg","bio":{"employment":"","home":"","languages":"","openEndedText":"Hey, I'm Matt.
