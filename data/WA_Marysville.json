We offer extras for our heroes.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning on keeping the car long term please let us know and we will make the car unavailable for others. About 50-60% of my cars are not visible to the public so the long term renters can keep them until they're done with them with no interruption.\r\n\r\nCheck in, Check outs are all remote and contactless. During your reservation I will send you easy and clear step by step instructions on how to do contactless check in, gain access to the car and let yourself in, and drop it off remotely.
