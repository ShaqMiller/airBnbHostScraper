But our main workhorse daily is a 2009 Honda Pilot.\r\n\r\nTuro has given us an opportunity to not only share our passion, but to help us generate an alternative stream of income and learn how to build a profitable business. These skills are valuable and we wish to pass that on to others.\r\n\r\nWe love to share cars that are special in more nuanced ways. Whether its driving a rare and rugged FJ Cruiser, a dynamically tuned Porsche Boxster, a Mazda3 with high luxurious build-quality, or a colorful MINI Cooper that allows you to truly express yourself, our cars are:\r\n🚙 Fun to drive\r\n😎 Enjoyable\n⏳ Timeless\r\n🔧 Up to date on maintenance\r\n⛑ Safe!\r\n\r\n🚘 We have some specialty cars that ONLY WE rent in the Bay Area -- such as the Toyota FJ Cruiser, Honda Element, and planning to add some more! A lot of our cars are older models, however we modernize them with aftermarket CarPlay systems.\r\n\r\nVisit us at www.roveautorentals.com for more details! We're a small fleet but growing!","school":""}}},"28260052":{"vehicles":[{"availability":null,"avgDailyPrice":{"amount":69.87,"currency":"USD"},"completedTrips":39,"estimatedQuote":null,"hostId":28260052,"id":1708467,"images":[{"originalImageUrl":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/ka2_cyLkRvmMf-4lPH5kqg.jpg","resizeableUrlTemplate":"https://images.turo.com/media/vehicle/images/ka2_cyLkRvmMf-4lPH5kqg.{width}x{height}.jpg"}],"isAllStarHost":true,"isFavoritedBySearcher":false,"isNewListing":false,"location":{"city":"Oakland","country":"US","distance":{"unit":"MILES","value":3.111509005033544},"homeLocation":{"lat":37.84461194918748,"lng":-122.25157285566898},"isDelivery":false,"locationId":null,"locationSlugs":{"fr_CA":"oakland-ca","en_GB":"oakland-ca","en_CA":"oakland-ca","en_US":"oakland-ca","en_AU":"oakland-ca","fr_FR":"oakland-ca"},"state":"CA"},"make":"Honda","model":"Pilot","rating":5,"seoCategory":"SUV","tags":[],"type":"SUV","year":2022}],"details":{"name":"Nick
