Text or call me at 405-252-0955.\r\n\r\nHi, I'm Scott, thanks so much for checking out my profile!  I take pride in making sure your rental goes smooth and easy!  Turo is an awesome platform and I love sharing it with new people.  If you have any questions about the process, feel free to contact me at the number above.\r\n\r\nI am a full-time Turo host, and my customers are my top priority!  When you book with me, you can be certain you will receive a clean, reliable, and well-maintained vehicle at a great price, and with excellent, convenient service!\r\n\r\nSave money and opt out of airport delivery!  Will Rogers World Airport (OKC) is now charging a 10% service fee for trips booked at the airport.  Please consider picking the car up from my default location in Edmond.  An Uber ride takes about 25 minutes and typically costs $25-$30.  You may also order delivery to a convenient address that is not on airport property to avoid paying the airport service fee.\r\n\r\nThe Turo marketplace has grown rapidly due to rental car shortages, and there are many new and inexperienced hosts on the platform. Don't jeopardize your travel plans by taking a chance on a host who may cancel your reservation at the last minute or provide a dirty or poorly maintained vehicle.  I have fulfilled over two thousand reservations, and have NEVER voluntarily cancelled someone's trip.  You can contact me any time if you need help with anything or have questions.  Count on my 5+ years of experience hosting on Turo and stellar reviews to make your trip a success!\r\n\r\nDelivery fees may be negotiable for delivery within the Edmond area.","school":""}}}}
