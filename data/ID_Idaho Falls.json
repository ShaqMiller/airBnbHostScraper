Sometimes we'll bring the kids, but we enjoy having a couple days together. We own rental cabins close to West Yellowstone and we respect other people's property just like we expect good guests to take care of our cabins. My wife and I have clean driving records and are very responsible. (her dad was a cop, so you know she was raised to drive good! LOL) We will take great care of your car and treat is as our own. I have owned a few Mustangs, and our daily driver is a Nissan NV3500 with a lift and 4X4 conversion. It's a $100K car and we baby that. So we know how to park a beast as well as sports cars and trucks. Thanks for letting us rent your vehicle!\r\nBy day I'm an insurance agent with New York Life and have been since 2005.
